Emailing Lantern Logs
====================

Occasionally the core Lantern developers will request for you to email them your logs to better diagnose an issue.

To do this you need to find the logs directory on your platform:

Windows Vista/7/8
'''''''''''''''''

``C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Lantern\logs``

Windows XP
''''''''''

``C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Lantern\Logs``

OSX
'''

``~/Library/Logs/Lantern``

Ubuntu
''''''

``~/.lantern/logs``

The directory should have files in it like ``java.log``, ``installer.log`` and others. 
Zip up the whole directory in to a single zip file. 
Sometimes it may only contain java.log, which is the most important file. 
You can zip it to be smaller, or just send it as is.

Attach the zip or the java log file to an email sent to contact [at]
getlantern.org. If you are very security focused and want a pgp email
address to send it to let us know and we can provide one.
