Privacy
=======

Lantern's central servers store the following information:

* Your e-mail address.
* The e-mail address of the account that invited you.
* The e-mail addresses of anyone you invite.
* A Google Talk "refresh token" which allows Lantern to run under your account from the cloud when your computer is asleep.

For more specific details on what information Lantern has access to, see the `Lantern Information Disclosure Matrix <https://docs.google.com/a/getlantern.org/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ap6nn0WEcFTRdHUtTm9GcFpsNFpoOGFXQlBfODN4TkE&single=true&gid=0&output=html>`_.

Giving Access
-------------
Participating in the Lantern network in Give Access mode means that people in your Lantern network can access the Internet through your computer. Your Lantern network is made up of the people you are friends with on Lantern, and their friends, branching out through 4 levels of connections.

We use the `Kaleidoscope Limited Advertisement Protocol <https://github.com/getlantern/kaleidoscope#kaleidoscope-limited-advertisement-protocol>`_ to ensure that Lantern users only share internet connections with people they are connected with through trusted friends.

Commitment to Your Privacy and Safety
-------------------------------------
Lantern takes the responsibility of providing internet access very seriously. It is extremely important to us that we limit how much information we store and that we keep your information secret.

All Lantern software and infrastructure has been configured with strong security protections and our data deletion policies are in accordance with our goal to allow everyone safe and uncensored access to the Internet. Only the core lantern developers have access to information that could identify you. Any contact they have with your data is related to making sure that Lantern is working correctly.

We will not use any information we collect for any purpose other than providing the Lantern service to you and others. If you would like us to delete your account and its associated information, please send us an e-mail at team@getlantern.org.
