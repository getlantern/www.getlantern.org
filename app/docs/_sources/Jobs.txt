Software Engineer Wanted

The Lantern team is on the lookout for an experienced full-stack engineer who is passionate about creating and preserving an open
Internet and about building tools to get around censors. 
Security and distributed computing experience are definite pluses but by no means requirements. 
While we’ll seriously consider any strong coder, applicants who are fluent in either JavaScript or Java will receive preference. 
We do sprinkle in a fair bit of Python, C, and C++ as well.

The Lantern team also adheres to the Obama campaign’s rule of “no drama, no assholes.” 
We’re a small, tight knit group of dedicated engineers who love what we do, and we like to think we’re a kind-hearted bunch. 
If you’re interested in joining a distributed team of non-asshole engineers working on exciting technology, please shoot us a note at jobs@getlantern.org!
