Lantern Cloud Servers
=====================

Lantern Cloud Servers are small Amazon `EC2
instances <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud>`__
that serve as fallbacks when there are not enough peer users online.

This ensures that people will be able to get connected, even if a friend
is not online. They help make the Lantern Network much more robust.

Unfortunately these servers cost money to maintain, so Brave New
Software, the organization behind Lantern, can only supply a limited
number of them. If you would like to help you can soon sponsor your own
Lantern Cloud Server at http://rally.org (coming soon) If you are in a
censored country this provides direct access for you and your friends.
And it's a great way to give from uncensored countries, increasing
the reliability of the Lantern Network.

Since our Rally integration is not yet working please get in touch at
contact [at] getlantern.org and we can take your donation and fire up a
dedicated server for you.
