    "SAFE_TO_USE_QUESTION": "Is Lantern safe for me to use?",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1": "Your Internet surfing is relatively safe with Lantern but it’s important to remember the following:",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2": "<strong>&mdash; HTTPS</strong>: Remember to always use use HTTPS and ideally to install the <a href='https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere' target='_blank'>HTTPS Everywhere browser extension</a>, because then your traffic is always encrypted and not viewable by anyone regardless of how you are accessing the Internet. As an added bonus Lantern doesn’t allow for false HTTPS certificates.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_3": "<strong>&mdash; Peers</strong>: A portion of all Lantern traffic is handled by peer proxies.  It is possible for censors and other untrusted 3rd parties to run these peer proxies.  You can prevent them from viewing the content of your traffic by using HTTPS, though the sites that you visit will be viewable by them.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_4": "<strong>&mdash; Cookies + Privacy</strong>: Lantern does prevent other sites from seeing your IP, though it cannot prevent proxies (either peers or cloud servers) from seeing your IP.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_5": "<strong>&mdash; IP addresses</strong>:  If you require that no one sees your IP address or physical location (they typically can, which may come as a surprise), then you might have a better chance in improving your privacy with <a target='_blank' href='https://www.torproject.org'>Tor</a>.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_6": "<strong>&mdash; Which tool is right for me?</strong>: In determining which tool to use, if speed and reliability of service are most important to you, Lantern is your tool. If you can tolerate slower speeds to post sensitive information on the Internet, you may want to use Tor.",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_QUESTION": "What information does Lantern collect about me?",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_ANSWER_1": "Lantern allows users to provide the Lantern team with useful debugging information as well as analytics, which you can configure in your Lantern settings. If you choose to send Lantern that data, we will not use it for any other purpose other than providing the Lantern service to you and others.",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_QUESTION": "How does Lantern work if I canʼt reach any users giving access?",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_1": "To help get the Lantern network started we have set up <a href=\"https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Lantern-Cloud-Servers\" target=\"_blank\">Lantern Cloud Servers</a>. These channel a significant amount of traffic. This ensures a higher reliability of service by having a variety of sources for Internet access",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_QUESTION": "How does Lantern compare to other tools?",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_1": "Lanternʼs goal is to give users access while being fast, secure, and easy to use. <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a> is another tool which is sometimes used for censorship circumvention, but Torʼs purpose is anonymity; circumvention is just a possible side effect. Because of this, Tor can be relatively slow to surf the web. For cases when anonymity is not necessary, Lantern provides an alternative with faster access. Compared to other tools aimed at access (GoAgent, Freegate, Ultrasurf, Psiphon, Autoproxy) Lanternʼs strength is the ease with which it can be installed and used, as well as its trusted peer-to-peer network architecture designed to scale in the presence of censors.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_2": "By default, Lantern runs as a system proxy, which means that browsers on your computer will use it automatically, without your having to change any of their settings. Some other tools only work with one specific browser, or require complex configuration.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_3": "Another unique aspect in Lanternʼs design is its peer-to-peer architecture, which allows data to come from many computers at once, rather than a single server. Peer-to-peer architectures also allow networks to scale to millions of users at a fraction of the cost of more centralized architectures.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_4": "Recently, the Lantern team has contributed to <a href=\"https://www.uproxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">uProxy</a>, a new effort sponsored by Google Ideas. While there are similarities between the two, there are also some important differences. For one, Lantern is an independent app that stays running in the background, while uProxy is a browser extension, and currently requires asking a single friend to proxy for you on a per-session basis, so with Lantern you can have many peers give you access at the same time as opposed to just one. Another difference is Lantern allows friends of friends up to 4 degrees away to connect to one another, whereas uProxy only allows direct friends. Finally, to be faster and more blocking resistant, by default Lantern proxies access only to a specific set of sites you configure (see below), whereas uProxy reroutes traffic to all sites through your uProxy peer while you have it enabled.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_QUESTION": "What is the Lantern proxied sites list?",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_1": "Lantern only provides access to blocked sites, and it does this through a default proxied sites list. Therefore, if a web site is unblocked, Lantern will get out of the way and use your regular Internet connection to send you directly to that site. That ensures that users are able to see unblocked content as quickly as possible and also that we don’t waste network resources providing access to content that is not blocked in the first place.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_2": "If you are not getting access to a blocked site, that does not necessarily mean that Lantern is not working. You may need to add that site to our list of blocked sites to get access. You can do this in the settings or send an email to us at <a target='_blank' href='mailto:team@getlantern.org'>team@getlantern.org</a>",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_QUESTION": "How does the trust network work? What happens when I add someone as a Lantern friend?",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is built on a trust network. This network connects people who trust one another to share internet connections. When you and another user are Lantern friends with one another, you can proxy traffic for one another using Lantern. However, if Lantern proxied only through direct friends, users would often have no proxies available whenever none of their direct friends were online giving access.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_2": "To mitigate this, Lantern users getting access can discover a subset of the users giving access up to 4 degrees away from them in the trust network. So for instance, if you use Lantern to get access, your brother’s partner’s mother’s friend could end up proxying your Lantern traffic. If this person is a censor, she could block or analyze your traffic. On the other hand, if you use Lantern to read or post something private or sensitive, it will look as though this traffic is coming from her computer. Because of this, everyone running Lantern should only friend people they trust, and <b>only use Lantern to proxy traffic that is not private or sensitive</b>.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_3": "By only adding people you trust, you protect not only yourself, but also your friends, their friends, their friendsʼ friends, and so on. And by allowing users to discover a subset of users farther away from them in the trust network, Lantern increases available proxies while maintaining blocking resistance.",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_QUESTION": "How do I download Lantern?",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is no longer accepting requests for invitations. In order to protect Lantern against infiltration by censors, all invitations are now made by friends to friends.  If you know and trust someone who is already using Lantern, please contact them to request an invitation.",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_QUESTION": "I live in an uncensored region and donʼt know anyone in a censored region. Can I still help?",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1": "Definitely! You can both run Lantern and invite more people to join the cause, even if those people also live in an uncensored region. When you run Lantern, you will be added to our DNS round-robin so that a small portion of overall traffic gets routed through your machine. While Lantern also runs its own servers to ensure a good quality of service, each user helps reduce that burden. <b>Our ultimate goal is to build a system that bypasses censorship even if we cease to exist as a company, and that is only possible if a lot of people run it to create new access points. When you invite more people, they will help lighten the load further for everyone</b>.",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_QUESTION": "OK, Iʼve installed Lantern. Now what?",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "For users in uncensored regions, there are two basic things you can do once youʼve installed Lantern:",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_2": "<strong>&mdash; Run Lantern as much as possible.</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_3": "<strong>&mdash; Add more users you trust as Lantern friends.</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_4": "Whenever you run Lantern, you create a new access point users in censored regions can use to access the open Internet. Remember, though, that your own social network is part of what enables Lantern to stay unblocked, so inviting your contacts to join the cause is an important step!",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_QUESTION": "Will Lantern make my computer vulnerable to hackers?",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_ANSWER_1": "Lantern takes a number of precautions to make sure users are safe. First, Lantern does not allow anyone it connects you to to read the contents of your computer. It simply allows you to share Internet connections. The data passing between you is encrypted so that no intermediaries (e.g. your government or Internet service provider or theirs) can read it. Lantern also requires mutual authentication for all connections, which means that Lantern will only allow users to connect to you that it can verify are in your Lantern network, and not just anyone.",
    "WHO_ARE_WE_QUESTION": "Who are we?",
    "WHO_ARE_WE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is built by the Brave New Software Project, Inc, a registered 501c3 non-profit dedicated to using software to tackle tough global challenges. Brave New Software’s founder and Lantern lead developer, Adam Fisk, was formerly a lead developer of the peer-to-peer file sharing services LimeWire and LittleShoot. While working on these P2P architectures, Adam realized they could be useful in providing unfiltered internet access. You can watch some of Adam’s talks about Lantern here and here.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_QUESTION": "Is Lantern free? Will running it cost me anything?",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is a free, open source software. It is free to use, modify, and redistribute.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_2": "If your Internet connection has a data limit, then giving access through Lantern will be included in your usage.",
    "SAFE_TO_PROVIDE_ACCESS_QUESTION": "Is it safe for me to use Lantern to provide access to the Internet?",
    "SAFE_TO_PROVIDE_ACCESS_ANSWER_1": "For users with unrestricted Internet access in the uncensored world running as access points, Lantern currently allows other people to access any site on the internet via your connection, including ones that you may disagree with or that may be illegal in your jurisdiction. In future releases of Lantern, those giving access will be able to limit which sites other people can access via their internet connection.",
    "CONTRIBUTE_QUESTION": "How can I contribute?",
